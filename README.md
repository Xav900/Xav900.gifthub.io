The picture above is from the game called Genshin Impact, One of the popular game today.
These are the amazing things that genshin impact lets the players play with awesome graphics and many other things to do (Spoiler warning for new Genshin impact players that wants to know the story of the game themselves).
- Its an open world game where you can explore different kinds of places in a world called teyvat and its a gacha game.
It starts off with 2 siblings, the boy who is known as aether and the girl known as lumine.

The 2 siblings got separated when they entered celestia and tried to battle one of the strongest god called unknown god.
In the game you can choose between aether and lumine who you want to use and the other sibling gets taken away by the god.
You start off with a quest that is leading to a place called Mondstadt it is famous for its wine and the bards that sing amazing songs.
There are different quests you have to do to  unlock certain places in the map and get to know the story more.
There is also an archon in disguise here in mondstadt his original archon name is barbatos but to keep his identity secret his name is now venti, he is the protector of mondstadt and is estimated to be 3000+ years old and became good friends with the traveller (either aether or lumine is called the traveller.)  (gods of the regions are called archon)
There are lots of chests scattered around the map, when you open these you can get weapons, artifacts, mora(currency in Genshin), and exp.

There are also side quests you can do to earn more primogems (primogems can be used to get limited characters to help defeat enemies) and mora which can be used to upgrade weapons and characters.
After you do a certain amount of quests and explore the map you can end up to liyue harbour its where ships from different regions go to to trade off their products or consult with someone in liyue.

In liyue it has specialties just like mondstadt, People in liyue like to cook and sell tasty food which can be used to heal your characters in desperate times.
In liyue, the God of geo (stone) is also undercover but after 6000 years he is already retired but is still helping people in need because people of liyue still praise the Geo archon.

Just a side note, There are different bosses around the map some being easy and some being hard, You can get different materials from each boss that can be used to upgrade your character's level and gain adventure rank experience ( The higher the rank, The more quests, area, bosses, and many other things you can do).
